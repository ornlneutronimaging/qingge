# QingGe's code

* Use Excel to convert VDrive output to inputs suitable for MTEX
  - Inputs to MTEX could be generated by VDRIVE (VDRIVE single peak fitting).
  - They are converted by Excel (Ducu created formulas here) to something suitable for mtex (copy and paste bank1 and bank2, and then there is a formula in excel to compute a table ("OutPut"). 
  - Copy the output to a text file (ducu.txt) (only first couple columns are needed)
* Use MTEX to generate several thousand grain orientations (pole figures). 
  - MTEX is available at vulcan2.sns.gov. Start Matlab 2014a. add directory /usr/local/mtex-3.5.0. startup_mtex
